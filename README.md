# AirBnb Listings in Amsterdam

## Introduction

This project is part of Corise's Python for Data Science week 2 course. We have been provided Airbnb Amsterdam data of 2012 in two files - one for listings and the other for maintaining the calender of the listings.

## Project Goal

To clean the data and present in in a way that we could filter and search.
